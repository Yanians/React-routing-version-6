  details:`
  While travel blogging is one of the most popular types of blogs, rest assured, you have not missed the boat (or plane) on your chance to start your own. While competition has increased over the years, so has demand: In fact, The World Travel & Tourism Council projects that travel and tourism in the United States will reach pre-pandemic levels in 2022, contributing nearly $2 trillion to the U.S. economy. 
  Today, the key to starting a travel blog is going into a niche and offering a specialty of focused content. New popular locations, adventures and hidden gems come to the surface every day. Even your own backyard and hometown might be unfamiliar to new readers, and you can add your unique perspectives to reviewing them. 
  In this guide, we'll help you navigate the field, from how to make a website and creating a blog to writing your posts and finding collaborations, to not only stand out but also get paid. Once you've learned how to start a travel blog, you'll have the world at your fingertips with this type of website.

    While you can cover all types of travel topics, choosing a niche will more easily lead to success. Think of who
    could benefit from your unique guidance and hone your content towards them. Not only will this naturally attract 
    an audience of repeat readers, it will simplify the process of monetizing your blog,
    as you’ll have a defined value to bring to partners.For example, Wix user Tales of Israel used her expertise as an Israeli resident to help citizens and tourists alike explore the country’s hidden corners.

       Some fall-themed collections tend to go overboard with the oranges and reds, making them less usable outside of a narrow window of time. What I love about the Fall State of Mind Collection is its subtlety. The white, tan, orange, and gold tones are more muted, meaning they can easily be incorporated into your content without feeling overwhelming or too on-the-nose for autumn.
       This makes the collection perfect for those who want to introduce seasonal elements into their content without completely overhauling their entire aesthetic. It’s subtle enough to work in the background while still delivering that cozy fall feel.
